# LinearRegression1
What is Regression?
Regression is Supervised Learning techniques.
Supervised Learning mean is it is an approach where a computer algorithm is trained using input data and the expected output

Regression: Dependent variable.  --> input
            Independent variable --> output
            
In regression we want to build a relationship between each feature and the output so that we can predict. If this relationship is linear, this algorithm called --> Linear Regression
Linear Regression is perhaps well-known and understood algorithm in statistics and machine learning.

Y = wX + b
Y = Depented Variable
w = Slop(weight)
X = Indepented Variable
b = Bias
